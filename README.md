An attempt to make a sentry client for go with a simplified and context friendly interface.
I find the official sentry-go to use a lot of patterns that aren't idiomatic, and it offers
a lot of bells and whistles that make it difficult to understand what's going on.

This library probably has bugs in it, so buyer beware.
