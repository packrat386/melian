An attempt to make a sentry client for go with a simplified and context friendly interface.
I find the official sentry-go to use a lot of patterns that aren't idiomatic, and it offers
a lot of bells and whistles that make it difficult to understand what's going on.

This library probably has bugs in it, so buyer beware.

For an example, see this gist: https://gist.github.com/packrat386/d9bf90f3732e3830354eed6d5e1eb338
